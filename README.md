My tutorial project
My name is Phil.  I love riding my bike.  To me; music is life. 
On this new line i'll introduce Adam my homey 
Adam pushes me to try tech stuff like this.  I dip my toes in out of curiosity but never get much deeper than that
Today i decided to push myself a bit more.  I get tired of being the least tech savvy person among my peers.
